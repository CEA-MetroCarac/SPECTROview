## SPECTROview : A Tool for Spectroscopic Data Processing and Visualization.

Spectroscopy techniques such as Raman Spectroscopy and Photoluminescence (PL) are widely used in various fields, including materials science, chemistry, biology, and geology. In recent years, these techniques have are increasingly finding their place in cleanroom environments, particularly within the microelectronics industry, where they serve as critical metrology tools for wafer-scale measurements. The data obtained from these in-line measurements (i.e., wafer data) require specific processing procedures, but existing software solutions are often not optimized for this type of data and typically lack plotting and visualization capabilities. Additionally, the licensing requirements of these software solutions can restrict access for a broader community of users.

SPECTROview addresses these gaps by providing a free, open-source software designed to enhance both data processing and data visualization workflows. By integrating advanced data handling features for both wafer-type data and standard spectroscopic data (such as 1D spectra and 2D maps), and offering customizable plotting options, SPECTROview empowers users to streamline the data processing and visualization process, making it more direct, efficient and rapid.

## Features:

- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux).
- Optimized user inferface for easy and quick inspection and comparison of spectra.
- Supports processing of spectral data (1D) and hyperspectral data (2D maps or wafer maps)*. 
- Ability to fit multiple spectra or 2Dmaps using predefined models or by creating custom fit models*.

**Fitting features are powered by the [fitspy](https://github.com/CEA-MetroCarac/fitspy) and [LMfit](https://lmfit.github.io/lmfit-py/) open-source packages.*
